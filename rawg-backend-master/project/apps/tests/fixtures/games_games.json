Welcome to the 1980s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one man&#39;s rise to the top of the criminal pile. Vice City, a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, was one of the most varied, complete and alive digital cities ever created. Combining open-world gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and given the opportunity to take it over as you choose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He&#39;s set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself.",

Apps can transform your mobile device into essential tools like a harmonica, disco ball or convincing moustache. Somewhere out there is the perfect storm of touchscreen technology to fix everything that\u2019s wrong with your life. And maybe all you\u2019re missing is the iFruit app. Maybe not. At least you\u2019ll have something to keep you entertained while your significant other prattles on endlessly about their day.<br /><br />iFruit hooks directly into your experience of Grand Theft Auto V with some fun activities to further postpone the need for real social interaction.  Keep up-to-date on the latest Grand Theft Auto V news, log into the Rockstar Games Social Club, stay connected on LifeInvader and launch other Rockstar Games apps.<br /><br />Los Santos Customs<br />The Los Santos Customs app offers players the freedom to create their ultimate vehicle in Grand Theft Auto V from anywhere. At the bar, on the beach, on the toilet. This is the future, we\u2019re almost sure of it. You can even create and reserve custom license plates for both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online \u2013 order your personalized plates before they\u2019re gone!  <br /><br />Also choose from paint jobs, window tints, smoke colors, wheels, hoods and spoilers. Upgrade your engine, brakes, exhaust, suspension, and accessorize with new lights, horns, tires and body armor. Place your order on-the-go and find it waiting for you in the garage the next time you play Grand Theft Auto V, or send your order in while playing and get a call from your local mechanic to swing by. Everybody\u2019s had some work done in Los Santos, so don\u2019t let your ride be the exception to the rule.  <br /><br />Chop the Dog<br />Depth of content, high production values, defecation. It\u2019s the app that has it all. Because who doesn\u2019t love tending to a virtual pet? Chop is Franklin\u2019s canine sidekick in Grand Theft Auto V. Look after him well in the \u201cChop the Dog\u201d app and you will reap the benefits when playing as Franklin in Grand Theft Auto V. Pet him, feed and water him, play fetch and tug-of-war, teach him tricks. Too much or too little of an activity, however, will cause Chop to become unhappy, and nobody likes an unhappy Rottweiler. Take Chop on walks to give him a chance to work off last night\u2019s steak and Piswasser and to mark his turf in the hood - defending his ladies, fending off gang members and even protecting the beach babes of Los Santos from unsightly tan lines by removing their bikinis. <br /><br />Looking after Chop successfully is reflected in his behavior in Grand Theft Auto V in a number of ways:<br /><br />\u2022 He will be more helpful and responsive to Franklin <br />\u2022 He will perform tricks such as sitting, begging and giving paw if properly trained through the app <br />\u2022 He will sniff out the nearest hidden items when the player takes him for a walk<br />\u2022 Earn enough credits through walks and proper caretaking and exchange them for new collars for Chop",
