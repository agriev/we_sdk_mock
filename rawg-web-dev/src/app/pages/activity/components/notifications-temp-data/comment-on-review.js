          "In Subsurface Circular you play as a detective Tek (sentient robots in this settings parlance) who takes on a case of disappearing Tek's from an upset Tek whose friend has disappeared. Across two or three hours you investigate, interviewing Tek's that get onto the train at each stop.<br/><br/>For a game that is entirely about sitting on a train interviewing robots, it's impressive how well the SC team maintains the compelling nature of the game. At no point was I ever bored, and the intrigue and characterisation of the Teks kept me playing right up until a fantastic ending decision that had me stop and think. I had to make lunch while I thought about what I'd do.<br/><br/>With a fascinating narrative and a low price point (I paid $10 NZD on the Nintendo eShop) I would say that Subsurface Circular is a must have.",
